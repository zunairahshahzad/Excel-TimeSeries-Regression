ðŸ”Ž**Summary**
Conducted **time series analysis** on Canadian wage trends and global GDP growth (1970â€“2021) using Excel; applied log transformations and **regression analysis** (linear and quadratic) to extract long-run trends and cyclical behavior.

ðŸ”Ž**Key Notes**
- Tools used: Microsoft Excel (regression tools, charting, formulas)
- Evaluated regression significance using RÂ² values, p-values, and confidence intervals to assess model fit and trend reliability.
- Performed time series decomposition to extract trend and cyclical components, revealing varying degrees of economic cycle synchronization across countries.
- Applied log transformations to stabilize variance and linearize growth. 
- Performed regression analysis (linear and quadratic) to extract long-run trends and detrended the data to study seasonal and cyclical behavior.
- Detrended data to isolate cyclical fluctuations and analyzed 
- Demonstrated economic reasoning and critical thinking through scenario-based analysis and interpretation of real-world data.
- Assessed gender wage inequality in Canada, revealing a narrowing wage gap and shared cyclical fluctuations between male and female earnings.
- Analyzed GDP per capita across Zambia, Panama, Fiji, and Comoros to evaluate economic growth, cycle synchronization, and convergence/divergence patterns.

ðŸ”Ž**Project Overview**
Conducted a time series analysis on real-world economic data to explore wage trends, inflation effects, and GDP growth patterns across countries as part of an Economics course I took at university. The analysis was divided into two parts: a Canadian wage study and a global economic development comparison using Excel. Analyzed real wage trends and inflation effects in Canada using nominal and CPI-adjusted wages from 1997 to 2021. The second part, modeled GDP per capita (1970â€“2017) for Zambia, Panama, Fiji, and Comoros using linear and quadratic regression on log-transformed data to study long-run growth patterns.

ðŸ”Ž**Problem Statement & Goal**
The project aimed to assess gender wage inequality over time in Canada and evaluate economic growth, business cycles, and convergence across four countries (Zambia, Panama, Fiji, and Comoros). Key challenges included handling non-stationary data and isolating long-term trends from cyclical fluctuations.

ðŸ”Ž**Tools & Techniques**
Used Excel for time series modeling and trend analysis. Applied log transformations to stabilize variance and linearize growth. Performed regression analysis (linear and quadratic) to extract long-run trends and detrended the data to study seasonal and cyclical behavior. Evaluated regression output using RÂ², p-values, and confidence intervals.

ðŸ”Ž**Data Analysis & Insights**
**Part A:** Wage Analysis (Canada): Real wage growth showed that female wages increased faster than male wages (0.15 vs 0.11 per year), with the gender gap narrowing over time. Detrended wages revealed positive cyclical comovement, indicating shared economic shocks.
**Part B:** GDP & Business Cycle Analysis (Global): Panama and Fiji demonstrated steady growth and positive comovement; Zambia showed inconsistent patterns due to different industrial bases. Detrending GDP with quadratic regression highlighted cyclical fluctuations and helped identify divergence/convergence patterns. Growth convergence analysis found no strong evidence for catch-up growth; outcomes were tied to institutional and structural factors.

ðŸ”Ž**Impact & Takeaways**
The project demonstrated how to interpret economic indicators over time and separate trends from noise. Developed skills in time series decomposition, regression interpretation, and cross-country economic analysis using real-world datasets. Reinforced concepts like inflation adjustment, wage inequality, cyclical behavior, and growth theory through hands-on application.
